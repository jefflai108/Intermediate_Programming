hw1a design: 
File input mechanism to get input form file. Reuse homework 0 code.  Use bitmask operation to output the binary form from the output of hw0. Use printf to generate the decimal form and output to the file using file output mechanism. 

hw1a problem encountered: 
Designing the do-while loop. Applying bitmask operation first time in actually coding.  

hw1b design:
Storing the data from the file in a character array for later access. Do while loop. Get user input. Helper function to display course information, which reuse code from hw0 but in a reverse way. 

hw1b problem encountered: 
Storing input from file. Bitmask operation logic.
