# Intermediate_Programming

Intermediate Programming is a C/C++ course I took in the summer of 2016 at Johns Hopkins University. The course is challenging but I teamed up with two great guys, John Kuhn and Vladimir Postnikov, for the final project. The final project is to create two games: American Checkers and Battleship. I worked on American Checkers while John and Vladimir worked on Battleship. Both are written in C++.
