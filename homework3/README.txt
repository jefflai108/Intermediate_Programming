Design: 
Create CourseCatalog struct to store each course. Use a function to load data to the CourseCatalog. Create linked list called LinkedList, including a pointer points to CourseCtalog so that one can easily access the data in it and a more efficient design. Create user interface using do-while loop. Function compareInfo to compare user input and courses in courseCatalog, and move the pointer to the desired position. To update course information, such as course title or credit assignment, in the course catalog, simply replace the content of CourseCatalog with the buffer that used to store user input. To add or remove course to and from the transcript, use the typical code, which takes year, semester, grade, trancript double pointer, course catalog pointer. Noted that to compare information with the given input (year, semester), i create two additional functions. CompareSemester is for adding course. MatchCourse is for removing course. Also noted that before executing add or remove funciton, a funcCourse function is necessary to determine whether a specified course is present in the transcript. Simply loop over every node in the linkedlist and compare infor with the given course catalog. At last, to calculate GPA, the calculate GPA function utilizes switch statments with multiply if-else statements, and returns the GPA. 

Problem Encountered: 
1. I'm not sure about how to free every node after using enter "q" to quite the program. I know i need to create a temporary linked list pointer and use while loop to loop over every node in the list, but i am confused of "how" to find my head pointer after executing multiply add-course and remove-course. I did have a fucntion freeNode to perform my intention, but not sure if it's correct. 

2. My printf in my display funciton  is behaving weirdly for some reason. My printf in the while loop is supposed to print out content of a single node in the transcript with an intended output like this "EN.600.120 4.0 Intermediate Programming 2015.S A/". Yet, for some reason, my year semester is overwritng my course identifier and create an output like this " 2015.S A/ 4.0 Intermediate Programming". The strange part is that it behaves like this for most of the courses except for certain course like EN.661.110, which behaves correctly. Moreover, if i split the printf into two with a new line character in between course title and 2015.S, the output is what i intented it to be (except in two lines). I am really confused and yet haven't found any solution or similar problems on piazza or stack overflow.
